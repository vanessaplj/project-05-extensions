## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

### What I learned

This one was definitely the most challenging project so far. It combines some of my recent learnings, such as media queries, with new javascript functions I have never used before, such as localStorage and sessionStorage.

### Continued development

I'd like to develop more projects involving localStorage and sessionStorage, in order to perfect my understanding and become more familiar with these structures.

### Useful resources

- [Window localStorage](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_win_localstorage.asp) - This helped me understand the mechanics of using localStorage.
- [Window sessionStorage](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_win_sessionstorage.asp) - This helped me understand the mechanics of using sessionStorage.
